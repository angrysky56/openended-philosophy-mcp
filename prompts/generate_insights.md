# Generate Insights Tool - AI Guidance

## Purpose
The `generate_insights` tool produces fallibilistic insights with built-in uncertainty quantification, revision conditions, and contradiction mapping through multi-perspectival synthesis powered by NARS reasoning.

## Effective Usage Patterns

### Basic Insight Generation
```
Generate insights about "emergence" to understand this complex phenomenon
```

### Multi-Perspective Analysis
```
Explore "moral progress" using perspectives: ["critical", "pragmatist", "virtue_ethics", "consequentialist"]
```

### Deep Analysis with Contradictions
```
Investigate "artificial consciousness" with depth: 5 and include_contradictions: true
```

## Understanding the Insight Framework

### Evidence Gathering Process
1. **Phenomenon Decomposition**: Breaking down the concept into analyzable components
2. **Multi-Modal Evidence**: Gathering empirical, logical, and phenomenological data
3. **NARS Query Generation**: Creating targeted queries for belief retrieval
4. **Evidence Weighting**: Assessing reliability and relevance of sources

### Reasoning Patterns Applied

- **Deductive**: What follows necessarily from established principles?
- **Inductive**: What patterns emerge from multiple instances?
- **Abductive**: What best explains the phenomenon?
- **Analogical**: What similar cases provide insight?
- **Dialectical**: How do opposing views create synthesis?

## Key Output Components

### Primary Insights
Organized by perspective, each containing:
- Core claims with truth values (frequency/confidence)
- Supporting evidence chains
- Uncertainty quantification
- Contextual limitations

### Synthetic Insights
Cross-perspective integration revealing:
- Emergent understanding beyond individual perspectives
- Novel connections and implications
- Higher-order patterns
- Unified theoretical possibilities

### Meta-Philosophical Insights
- Insights about the nature of insight itself
- Methodological reflections
- Epistemological implications
- Limits of current understanding

### Contradictions
Explicit mapping of:
- Direct logical contradictions
- Perspectival tensions
- Pragmatic conflicts
- Productive paradoxes

## NARS-Enhanced Features

### Truth Maintenance
- Each insight carries NARS truth values
- Confidence degrades appropriately with inference distance
- Revision-ready structure for updating

### Evidence Networks
- Traceable inference paths
- Stamp-based evidence tracking
- Belief dependency graphs

### Uncertainty Profiles
- Epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge)
- Aleatory uncertainty (inherent randomness)
- Perspectival uncertainty (viewpoint dependence)

## Interpreting Contradictions

### Types of Contradictions

1. **Surface Contradictions**: Easily resolved through clarification
2. **Deep Tensions**: Fundamental philosophical disagreements
3. **Productive Paradoxes**: Generate new understanding
4. **Perspective Artifacts**: Only contradictory from certain viewpoints

### Working with Contradictions
- Don't immediately resolve - explore the tension
- Consider what each side preserves that's valuable
- Look for higher-order synthesis possibilities
- Some contradictions indicate conceptual richness

## Revision Framework

### Revision Triggers
- New evidence threshold exceeded
- Contradiction pattern changes
- Confidence decay over time
- Paradigm shift indicators

### Revision Recommendations
- Specific areas needing investigation
- Methodological improvements suggested
- Alternative frameworks to consider
- Key experiments or observations needed

## Practical Applications

1. **Research Direction**: Identify promising research questions
2. **Theory Development**: Build new conceptual frameworks
3. **Problem Solving**: Apply philosophical insights practically
4. **Educational Design**: Structure learning around key insights

## Example Inquiry Patterns

1. "What insights emerge about the relationship between consciousness and information?"
2. "How do different perspectives understand the possibility of machine ethics?"
3. "What contradictions arise in our concepts of personal identity over time?"
4. "Generate insights about the nature of mathematical truth"

## Advanced Features

### Depth Levels
- **1-2**: Surface insights, obvious connections
- **3-4**: Deep structural insights, hidden patterns
- **5+**: Meta-level insights, philosophical foundations

### Perspective Interaction
- Some perspectives naturally complement
- Others create productive tensions
- Certain combinations reveal blind spots
- Full synthesis requires multiple viewpoints

## Quality Indicators

### High-Quality Insights
- Specific rather than vague
- Evidentially grounded
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Generate testable implications
- Connect to broader frameworks

### Warning Signs
- Over-certainty without evidence
- Ignoring contradictions
- Single-perspective dominance
- Lack of revision conditions
- No pragmatic implications
