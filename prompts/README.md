# Prompts for OpenEnded Philosophy MCP with NARS Integration

This directory contains prompt templates to guide AI assistants in effectively using the philosophical reasoning tools integrated with NARS (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System).

## Tool Overview

The OpenEnded Philosophy MCP server provides five main tools that combine philosophical analysis with NARS's non-axiomatic reasoning:

1. **analyze_concept** - Multi-perspective conceptual analysis with uncertainty quantification
2. **explore_coherence** - Maps coherence patterns in conceptual landscapes
3. **contextualize_meaning** - Derives contextual semantics through language game analysis
4. **generate_insights** - Produces fallibilistic insights with contradiction mapping
5. **test_philosophical_hypothesis** - Tests hypotheses across domains with coherence analysis

## Key Features

- **Non-Axiomatic Reasoning**: All tools use NARS for reasoning under uncertainty
- **Truth Maintenance**: Frequency/confidence pairs track evidential support
- **Multi-Perspective Synthesis**: Integrates various philosophical viewpoints
- **Epistemic Humility**: Built-in uncertainty quantification and revision conditions
- **Coherence Landscapes**: Maps conceptual stability and phase transitions

## Best Practices

1. Always specify context when analyzing concepts
2. Use multiple perspectives for comprehensive analysis
3. Pay attention to uncertainty profiles in results
4. Consider revision conditions for evolving understanding
5. Look for contradictions as sources of philosophical insight
