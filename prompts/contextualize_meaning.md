# Contextualize Meaning Tool - AI Guidance

## Purpose
The `contextualize_meaning` tool derives contextual semantics through Wittgensteinian language game analysis, demonstrating how meaning emerges from use within specific practices and forms of life.

## Conceptual Framework

### Language Games
Drawing from Wittgenstein's philosophy, this tool recognizes that meaning is not fixed but emerges through use within specific contexts:
- **Rule-governed activities** where words gain significance
- **Forms of life** that provide the backdrop for understanding
- **Family resemblances** connecting related uses without essential definitions

## Available Language Games

### 1. Scientific Discourse
- **Characteristics**: Empirical verification, mathematical formalism, peer review
- **Success Conditions**: Predictive accuracy, experimental reproducibility
- **Key Terms**: hypothesis, evidence, measurement, causation

### 2. Ethical Deliberation  
- **Characteristics**: Normative reasoning, value pluralism, moral imagination
- **Success Conditions**: Action guidance, conflict resolution, moral coherence
- **Key Terms**: ought, duty, virtue, consequence, rights

### 3. Aesthetic Judgment
- **Characteristics**: Subjective validity, cultural context, expressive content
- **Success Conditions**: Resonance, critical appreciation, creative expression
- **Key Terms**: beauty, sublime, taste, form, expression

### 4. Ordinary Language
- **Characteristics**: Pragmatic success, contextual flexibility, social coordination
- **Success Conditions**: Mutual understanding, practical efficacy
- **Key Terms**: Common words gain specialized meanings through use

## Effective Usage Patterns

### Basic Contextualization
```
Contextualize "truth" within scientific_discourse to understand its operational meaning
```

### With Semantic Genealogy
```
Explore "justice" in ethical_deliberation with trace_genealogy: true to see historical evolution
```

### Comparative Analysis
```
Compare how "knowledge" functions across scientific_discourse and ordinary_language contexts
```

## Understanding Output

### Primary Meaning
The core semantic content as used within the specified language game, including:
- Operational definitions
- Pragmatic functions
- Contextual constraints

### Usage Patterns
Common ways the expression appears:
- Typical grammatical constructions
- Collocational patterns
- Pragmatic markers

### Family Resemblances
Related concepts sharing overlapping features without essential commonality:
- Conceptual neighbors
- Analogical extensions
- Metaphorical connections

### Pragmatic Conditions
What must be in place for successful use:
- Background assumptions
- Social/institutional contexts
- Practical prerequisites

### Meaning Stability
How consistent the meaning remains:
- Cross-context variability
- Historical stability
- Resistance to change

## Semantic Genealogy Features

When trace_genealogy is enabled:

### Historical Layers
- **Classical Period**: Original philosophical uses
- **Modern Transformations**: Enlightenment reconfigurations
- **Contemporary Shifts**: Current semantic evolution

### Semantic Drift Patterns
- Meaning expansion/contraction
- Metaphorical extensions
- Technical specializations
- Popular appropriations

### Critical Junctures
Points where meaning significantly shifted:
- Paradigm changes
- Cultural transformations
- Technological influences
- Theoretical innovations

## NARS Integration

### Belief-Based Semantics
- Meaning grounded in belief networks
- Truth values influence semantic weight
- Evidence accumulation shapes understanding

### Dynamic Meaning Updates
- Semantic revision through new evidence
- Confidence-weighted interpretations
- Temporal meaning evolution

## Practical Applications

### 1. Conceptual Clarification
Resolve ambiguities by specifying context:
"What does 'freedom' mean in political vs. metaphysical discourse?"

### 2. Cross-Cultural Understanding
Navigate semantic differences:
"How does 'honor' function in different cultural language games?"

### 3. Interdisciplinary Translation
Bridge disciplinary divides:
"Translate 'information' from computer science to biology contexts"

### 4. Historical Analysis
Track conceptual evolution:
"How has 'democracy' transformed from ancient to modern usage?"

## Interpretive Guidelines

### High Stability (>0.8)
The expression has consistent, well-established usage within this language game. Meaning is reliable and broadly shared.

### Moderate Stability (0.5-0.8)
The expression shows general consistency with some contextual variation. Users should attend to specific contexts.

### Low Stability (<0.5)
The expression is contested, evolving, or highly context-dependent. Multiple interpretations coexist.

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Metalinguistic Analysis
Examine how language games themselves are discussed:
"Contextualize 'language game' in ordinary_language"

### 2. Border Concepts
Explore terms that cross language games:
"How does 'truth' migrate between scientific and ethical contexts?"

### 3. Emerging Meanings
Track new semantic developments:
"Contextualize 'AI consciousness' in current philosophical discourse"

### 4. Critical Deconstruction
Reveal hidden assumptions:
"What does 'rationality' presuppose in economic discourse?"

## Questions for Exploration

- "How does context shape the meaning of fundamental concepts?"
- "What gets lost in translation between language games?"
- "Which meanings remain stable across contexts?"
- "How do new language games emerge and transform meaning?"
