# Explore Coherence Tool - AI Guidance

## Purpose
The `explore_coherence` tool maps provisional coherence patterns in conceptual space, identifying stable regions, phase transitions, and emergent structures through NARS-based topological analysis.

## Effective Usage Patterns

### Basic Exploration
```
Explore coherence in the domain of "consciousness" to map its conceptual landscape
```

### Deep Analysis
```
Examine "ethics" with depth: 5 to uncover multi-layered coherence structures
```

### With Revision Enabled
```
Explore "knowledge" domain with allow_revision: true to adapt the landscape during analysis
```

## Understanding Coherence Landscapes

### Conceptual Layers

1. **Foundational Concepts** (Layer 0)
   - Core terms and their definitional coherence
   - Concept relations and semantic networks
   - Stability assessment of base concepts

2. **Relational Structures** (Layer 1)
   - How concepts connect and support each other
   - Network density and connectivity patterns
   - Emergent relational properties

3. **Systematic Integration** (Layer 2)
   - Higher-order patterns and meta-structures
   - Conceptual unity within the domain
   - Integration challenges and opportunities

4. **Meta-Theoretical Framework** (Layer 3+)
   - Philosophical assumptions and commitments
   - Theoretical coherence at abstract levels
   - Deep structural patterns

## Key Output Components

### Coherence Metrics

- **coherence_score**: Overall coherence measure (0-1)
- **stability_gradient**: How coherence changes across layers
- **semantic_coherence**: Meaning consistency within domain

### Philosophical Structures

- **hierarchical_structures**: Foundational dependencies
- **network_structures**: Interconnected concept webs
- **dialectical_structures**: Tension-resolution patterns
- **emergent_structures**: Novel organizational principles

### Dynamical Features

- **attractors**: Conceptually stable regions that draw related ideas
- **phase_transitions**: Points where understanding shifts qualitatively
- **stability_analysis**: Robustness of conceptual framework

## NARS-Enhanced Features

- **Belief Networks**: Concepts connected through NARS inference rules
- **Truth Propagation**: Coherence influenced by truth value flows
- **Evidence Accumulation**: Stronger coherence from converging evidence
- **Uncertainty Mapping**: Regions of high/low epistemic confidence

## Example Interpretations

### High Coherence (>0.8)
"The domain shows strong conceptual integration with stable foundations and clear relational structures. Ideas support each other through multiple pathways."

### Moderate Coherence (0.5-0.8)
"The domain exhibits decent organization with some tensions. Certain concepts are well-integrated while others remain peripheral or contested."

### Low Coherence (<0.5)
"The domain displays conceptual fragmentation with competing frameworks. This may indicate an emerging field or fundamental philosophical disagreements."

## Practical Applications

1. **Philosophy Research**: Identify well-developed vs. emerging areas
2. **Conceptual Clarification**: Find sources of confusion or ambiguity
3. **Theory Development**: Discover gaps needing theoretical work
4. **Educational Planning**: Structure learning based on coherence patterns

## Advanced Usage Tips

1. **Cross-Domain Comparison**: Explore multiple domains to compare maturity
2. **Temporal Analysis**: Track how coherence evolves over time
3. **Intervention Points**: Identify where new concepts could strengthen coherence
4. **Critical Nodes**: Find concepts whose removal would fragment the domain

## Questions to Guide Exploration

- "What makes this domain coherent or incoherent?"
- "Where are the conceptual fault lines?"
- "Which ideas serve as conceptual anchors?"
- "How might this landscape evolve?"
