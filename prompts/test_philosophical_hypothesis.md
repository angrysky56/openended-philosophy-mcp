# Test Philosophical Hypothesis Tool - AI Guidance

## Purpose
The `test_philosophical_hypothesis` tool rigorously evaluates philosophical propositions through coherence analysis, pragmatic evaluation, and multi-domain testing with NARS-based confidence metrics and revision recommendations.

## Conceptual Framework

### Hypothesis Testing in Philosophy
Unlike empirical sciences, philosophical hypothesis testing involves:
- **Coherence Evaluation**: How well does it fit with established beliefs?
- **Pragmatic Assessment**: What practical difference does it make?
- **Cross-Domain Validity**: Does it hold across different contexts?
- **Dialectical Robustness**: Can it withstand critical examination?

## Effective Usage Patterns

### Basic Hypothesis Testing
```
Test the hypothesis "consciousness is fundamentally computational"
```

### Multi-Domain Testing
```
Evaluate "moral facts exist independently of human beliefs" across domains: ["ethics", "metaphysics", "epistemology"]
```

### With Custom Criteria
```
Test "free will is compatible with determinism" using criteria: {
  "logical_consistency": 0.8,
  "empirical_adequacy": 0.6,
  "pragmatic_value": 0.7
}
```

## Understanding Test Domains

### Core Philosophical Domains

1. **Metaphysics**
   - Tests ontological commitments
   - Examines reality claims
   - Evaluates existence conditions

2. **Epistemology**
   - Tests knowledge claims
   - Examines justification
   - Evaluates truth conditions

3. **Ethics**
   - Tests normative implications
   - Examines value commitments
   - Evaluates action guidance

4. **Logic**
   - Tests formal validity
   - Examines inference patterns
   - Evaluates consistency

5. **Phenomenology**
   - Tests experiential adequacy
   - Examines consciousness claims
   - Evaluates first-person validity

## Output Interpretation

### Domain Results
For each test domain, you'll receive:

1. **Supporting Evidence**
   - Beliefs that corroborate the hypothesis
   - Inference chains showing support
   - Truth values for each piece of evidence

2. **Challenges**
   - Conflicting beliefs or principles
   - Logical tensions
   - Empirical counterexamples

3. **Coherence Metrics**
   - Internal consistency within domain
   - Fit with established knowledge
   - Explanatory power assessment

### Overall Assessment

#### Coherence Score (0-1)
- **>0.8**: Strong coherence across domains
- **0.6-0.8**: Moderate coherence with some tensions
- **0.4-0.6**: Significant challenges requiring revision
- **<0.4**: Fundamental incoherence or contradiction

#### Pragmatic Score (0-1)
Evaluates practical implications:
- Problem-solving capacity
- Action guidance
- Theoretical fertility
- Empirical predictions

#### Confidence Level
NARS-derived confidence based on:
- Evidence quality
- Inference strength  
- Cross-domain consistency
- Evidential support breadth

## NARS-Enhanced Features

### Truth Value Propagation
- Hypothesis inherits truth from supporting evidence
- Confidence weakens with inference distance
- Contradictions reduce overall confidence

### Evidence Networks
- Traceable support/challenge chains
- Weighted evidence aggregation
- Belief revision pathways

### Temporal Testing
- How hypothesis fares over time
- Stability under new evidence
- Historical precedent analysis

## Evaluation Criteria

### Default Criteria

1. **Logical Consistency**
   - Internal coherence
   - Non-contradiction
   - Valid inference patterns

2. **Empirical Adequacy**
   - Fit with observed phenomena
   - Predictive success
   - Explanatory scope

3. **Theoretical Virtues**
   - Simplicity
   - Generality
   - Elegance
   - Fertility

4. **Pragmatic Value**
   - Problem-solving utility
   - Action guidance
   - Social implications

### Custom Criteria Examples

For consciousness theories:
```javascript
{
  "phenomenological_adequacy": 0.9,
  "neural_compatibility": 0.7,
  "computational_feasibility": 0.6,
  "explanatory_power": 0.8
}
```

For ethical theories:
```javascript
{
  "universalizability": 0.8,
  "practical_guidance": 0.9,
  "intuition_alignment": 0.6,
  "cultural_sensitivity": 0.7
}
```

## Interpreting Results

### Strong Support Indicators
- High coherence across multiple domains
- Convergent evidence from different sources
- Successful pragmatic applications
- Few unresolved challenges

### Revision Need Indicators
- Domain-specific failures
- Persistent contradictions
- Low pragmatic value
- High uncertainty in core claims

### Rejection Indicators
- Fundamental logical inconsistency
- Empirical falsification
- Ethical unacceptability
- Complete pragmatic failure

## Advanced Testing Strategies

### 1. Comparative Testing
Test competing hypotheses simultaneously:
"Compare 'consciousness is emergent' vs 'consciousness is fundamental'"

### 2. Conditional Testing
Test hypotheses under specific assumptions:
"Test 'moral realism' assuming naturalism"

### 3. Dialectical Testing
Test thesis, antithesis, and synthesis:
"Evaluate the dialectic of free will vs determinism"

### 4. Historical Testing
Compare with historical precedents:
"Test 'AI consciousness' against historical consciousness theories"

## Practical Applications

### 1. Theory Development
- Identify weak points needing reinforcement
- Discover unexpected implications
- Guide theoretical refinements

### 2. Philosophical Counseling
- Test life philosophy coherence
- Evaluate belief system consistency
- Guide worldview development

### 3. Applied Ethics
- Test ethical principles in practice
- Evaluate policy philosophical foundations
- Guide moral decision-making

### 4. Interdisciplinary Integration
- Test cross-disciplinary hypotheses
- Evaluate unified theories
- Guide synthetic thinking

## Questions for Exploration

1. "Is this hypothesis internally consistent?"
2. "What evidence supports or challenges it?"
3. "How does it fare across different domains?"
4. "What practical difference would its truth make?"
5. "What would it take to revise or reject it?"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-Certainty**: Philosophy rarely yields absolute proof
2. **Domain Fixation**: Test across multiple relevant domains
3. **Evidence Cherry-Picking**: Consider challenges seriously
4. **Pragmatic Neglect**: Truth without use is incomplete
5. **Static Testing**: Hypotheses evolve with new evidence
