Based on the analysis, emergence exhibits several key philosophical features:

1. IRREDUCIBILITY: Emergent properties cannot be fully reduced to their base components,
   suggesting ontological novelty at higher levels of organization.

2. LEVEL DISTINCTION: Emergence requires distinguishing between levels of description,
   with properties manifesting at higher levels that are absent at lower levels.

3. EPISTEMIC CHALLENGE: High uncertainty (avg {avg_uncertainty:.2f}) reflects the fundamental
   difficulty in understanding how qualitatively new properties arise.

4. DOMAIN UNIVERSALITY: Emergence appears across domains (mind, life, systems),
   suggesting it may be a fundamental feature of complex organization.

5. CAUSAL AMBIGUITY: The relationship between levels remains contested, particularly
   regarding downward causation and the causal efficacy of emergent properties.
