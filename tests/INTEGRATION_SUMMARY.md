# NARS-GPT + OpenEnded Philosophy MCP Integration

## Overview

I've successfully integrated NARS-GPT/ONA (Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System) with your OpenEnded Philosophy MCP server. This creates a powerful philosophical reasoning system that combines:

- **NARS's formal reasoning** with uncertainty quantification
- **Philosophical pluralism** without privileging any single perspective  
- **Truth maintenance** through evidence-based belief revision
- **Epistemic humility** with built-in revision conditions

## Key Integration Points

### 1. Truth Value System
- NARS (frequency, confidence) pairs for all philosophical claims
- Automatic belief revision when contradictions arise
- Evidence tracking through stamp IDs
- Temporal reasoning with confidence decay

### 2. Enhanced Memory System
- Semantic embeddings + NARS attention buffer
- Philosophical categorization (metaphysical, epistemological, ethical, etc.)
- Coherence landscape generation
- Evidence-based belief prioritization

### 3. Multi-Pattern Reasoning
- **Deductive**: From principles to conclusions
- **Inductive**: From instances to general rules
- **Abductive**: Best explanation inference
- **Analogical**: Similarity-based transfer
- **Dialectical**: Synthesis through opposition

### 4. Philosophical Tools Enhanced
All five MCP tools now integrate NARS reasoning:
- `analyze_concept`: Multi-perspective analysis with truth values
- `explore_coherence`: Belief network coherence mapping
- `contextualize_meaning`: Language games with evidence tracking
- `generate_insights`: Fallibilistic insights with revision conditions
- `test_philosophical_hypothesis`: NARS-based hypothesis evaluation

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Works without ONA, falling back to pure philosophical analysis
2. **Process Safety**: Comprehensive cleanup prevents resource leaks
3. **Asynchronous Design**: Non-blocking NARS queries
4. **Memory Persistence**: Saves philosophical knowledge between sessions

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
cd /home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/openended-philosophy-mcp
./setup.sh
```

### Testing
```bash
# Test server functionality
uv run python test_server.py

# Demo NARS features
uv run python demo_nars.py
```

### Claude Desktop Config
Add to your Claude Desktop configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openended-philosophy": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/home/ty/Repositories/ai_workspace/openended-philosophy-mcp",
        "run",
        "openended-philosophy-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Philosophical Implications

This integration realizes several philosophical goals:

1. **Non-foundationalism**: No fixed axioms, all beliefs revisable
2. **Coherentism**: Truth emerges from belief network coherence
3. **Pragmatism**: Emphasis on practical consequences
4. **Pluralism**: Multiple valid perspectives without hierarchy
5. **Fallibilism**: All knowledge provisional and uncertain

## Technical Notes

- ONA subprocess managed with proper signal handling
- NLTK for lemmatization (following NARS-GPT approach)
- Scikit-learn for semantic similarity calculations
- Truth functions implement full NAL inference rules
- Memory uses both NARS stamps and embeddings

## Future Enhancements

Possible extensions:
- Real-time belief streaming from ONA
- Causal inference through NARS temporal logic
- Multi-agent philosophical dialogue
- Integration with your Algorithm Platform
- Visual coherence landscape rendering

The server is now ready for use! You can restart Claude Desktop to load the enhanced philosophy MCP with NARS reasoning capabilities.
